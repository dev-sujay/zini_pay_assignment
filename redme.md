# Zini Pay Assignment

This is an Expo-based React Native project for handling background tasks, such as logging and SMS syncing, with error handling for login failures and sync attempts.

## Features
- **Background task management**: Logs tasks every 5 seconds.
- **SMS Syncing**: Handles SMS syncing when the device is online, and queues syncs during offline periods.
- **Error handling**: Alerts the user on failed login or sync attempts.
- **Notification system**: Displays notifications when the app is running in the background.
